{{partial:partials/session-replay/sr-android-eap :when="alpha"}}

This article covers the installation of Session Replay using the Android SDK plugin. If your app is already instrumented with Amplitude, use this option. If you use a provider other than Amplitude for in-product analytics, choose the [standalone implementation](/docs/session-replay/session-replay-android-standalone).

{{partial:partials/session-replay/sr-android-performance}}

Session Replay captures changes to an app's view tree, this means the main view and all it's child views recursively. It then replays these changes to build a video-like replay. For example, at the start of a session, Session Replay captures a full snapshot of the app's view tree. As the user interacts with the app, Session Replay captures each change to the view as a diff. When you watch the replay of a session, Session Replay applies each diff back to the original view tree in sequential order, to construct the replay. Session replays have no maximum length.

## Before you begin

Use the latest version of the Session Replay plugin above `{{sdk_versions:session_replay_android_plugin}}`. For a list of all available versions, see [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.amplitude/plugin-session-replay-android/versions).

The Session Replay Android plugin requires that:

1. Your application is Android-based.
2. You can provide a device identifier to the SDK.

{{partial:partials/session-replay/sr-android-supported-versions}}

## Quickstart

Add the [latest version](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.amplitude/plugin-session-replay-android/versions) of the plugin to your project dependencies.

```kotlin
// Install latest version from Maven Central
implementation("com.amplitude:plugin-session-replay-android:@{$ android.session_replay.version $}")
// You will also need the Amplitude Analytics SDK if it's not already installed
implementation("com.amplitude:analytics-android:[1.16.7, 2.0.0]")
```

Configure your application code:

```kotlin
import com.amplitude.android.Amplitude
import com.amplitude.android.Configuration
import com.amplitude.android.plugins.SessionReplayPlugin

// Initialize Amplitude Analytics SDK instance
val amplitude = Amplitude(Configuration(
    apiKey = API_KEY,
    context = applicationContext,
    defaultTracking = DefaultTrackingOptions(sessions = true),
))

// Create and Install Session Replay Plugin
// Recording will be handled automatically
val sessionReplayPlugin = SessionReplayPlugin(sampleRate = 1.0)
amplitude.add(sessionReplayPlugin)

// Send replay data to the server
amplitude.flush()
```

## Configuration

Pass the following option when you initialize the Session Replay plugin:

| Name              | Type      | Required | Default         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sampleRate`      | `number`  | No       | `0`             | Use this option to control how many sessions to select for replay collection. <br></br>The number should be a decimal between 0 and 1, for example `0.4`, representing the fraction of sessions to have randomly selected for replay collection. Over a large number of sessions, `0.4` would select `40%` of those sessions. |

### Track default session events

Session replay requires that you configure default session event tracking. This ensures that Session Replay captures Session Start and Session End events. If you didn't capture these events before you implement Session Replay, expect an increase in event volume. For more information about session tracking, see [Android SDK | Tracking Sessions](/docs/sdks/analytics/android/android-kotlin-sdk#track-sessions).


{{partial:tabs tabs="SDK configuration, Plugin configuration"}}
{{partial:tab name="SDK configuration"}}
Use the Android SDK configuration to explicitly enable session tracking.

```kotlin
val amplitude = Amplitude(Configuration(
    apiKey = API_KEY,
    context = applicationContext,
    defaultTracking = DefaultTrackingOptions(sessions = true),
))

amplitude.add(SessionReplayPlugin(/* session replay options */))
```
{{/partial:tab}}
{{partial:tab name="Plugin configuration"}}
Disable all default tracking by the Android SDK. In this case, the Session Replay plugin enables default session tracking automatically.

```kotlin
val amplitude = Amplitude(Configuration(
    apiKey = API_KEY,
    context = applicationContext,
    defaultTracking = DefaultTrackingOptions(sessions = false),
))

// The plugin will update the configuration to DefaultTrackingOptions(sessions = true)
amplitude.add(SessionReplayPlugin(/* session replay options */))
```
{{/partial:tab}}
{{/partial:tabs}}

{{partial:partials/session-replay/sr-android-mask-data}}

### User opt-out

The Session Replay plugin follows the Android SDK's `optOut` setting, and doesn't support user opt-outs on its own.

```kotlin
// Set optOut on the Amplitude SDK
val amplitude = Amplitude(Configuration(
    apiKey = API_KEY,
    optOut = true,
    /* other configuration */
))
amplitude.add(SessionReplayPlugin(/* session replay options */))
```

{{partial:partials/session-replay/sr-eu-data-residency}}

```kotlin
// Set serverZone on the Amplitude SDK
val amplitude = Amplitude(Configuration(
    apiKey = API_KEY,
    serverZone = ServerZone.EU,
    /*, other configuration */
))
amplitude.add(SessionReplayPlugin(/* session replay options */))
```

{{partial:partials/session-replay/sr-sampling-rate}}

```kotlin
// This configuration samples 1% of all sessions
amplitude.add(SessionReplayPlugin(sampleRate = 0.01))
```

### Disable replay collection

Once enabled, Session Replay runs on your app until either:

- The user leaves your app
- You call `amplitude.remove(sessionReplayPlugin)`

Call `amplitude.remove(sessionReplayPlugin)` before a user navigates to a restricted area of your app to disable replay collection while the user is in that area.

{{partial:admonition type="note" heading="Keep a reference"}}
This requires keeping a reference to the SessionReplayPlugin instance `val sessionReplayPlugin = SessionReplayPlugin(/* session replay options */)`.
{{/partial:admonition}}

Call `amplitude.add(sessionReplayPlugin)` to re-enable replay collection when the return to an unrestricted area of your app.

You can also use a feature flag product like Amplitude Experiment to create logic that enables or disables replay collection based on criteria like location. For example, you can create a feature flag that targets a specific user group, and add that to your initialization logic:

```kotlin
import com.amplitude.android.Amplitude
import com.amplitude.android.Configuration
import com.amplitude.android.plugins.SessionReplayPlugin

// Your existing initialization logic with Android SDK
val amplitude = Amplitude(Configuration(apiKey = API_KEY /*, ... other configuration */))

if (nonEUCountryFlagEnabled) {
  // Create and Install Session Replay Plugin
  val sessionReplayPlugin = SessionReplayPlugin(sampleRate = 0.5)
  amplitude.add(sessionReplayPlugin)
}
```

{{partial:partials/session-replay/sr-data-retention}}

{{partial:partials/session-replay/sr-android-storage}}

Amplitude recommends setting `flushEventsOnClose = true` in the Amplitude SDK Configuration (the default) to send session data to the server on each app exit.

{{partial:partials/session-replay/sr-android-known-limitations}}

- When using the plugin, session events must be enabled on the SDK. Learn more in [Tracking default sessions events](#track-default-session-events).

### Multiple Amplitude instances

Session Replay supports attaching to a single instance of the Amplitude SDK. If you have more than one instance instrumented in your application, make sure to start Session Replay on the instance that most relates to your project.

{{partial:partials/session-replay/sr-android-troubleshooting}}

### Captured sessions contain limited information

Session Replay requires that the Android SDK send `[Amplitude] Session Start` and `[Amplitude] Session End` events, at a minimum. If you instrument events outside of the Android SDK, Amplitude doesn't tag those events as part of the session replay. This means you can't use tools like Funnel, Segmentation, or Journeys charts to find session replays. You can find session replays with the User Sessions chart or through User Lookup.

If you use a method other than the Android SDK to instrument your events, consider using the [Session Replay Standalone SDK for Android](/docs/session-replay/session-replay-android-standalone/).

### Replay length and session length don't match

In some scenarios, the length of a replay may exceed the time between the `[Amplitude] Start Session` and `[Amplitude] End Session` events. This happens when a user closes the `[Amplitude] End Session` occurs, but before the Android SDK and Session Replay plugin can process it. When the user uses the app again, the SDK and plugin process the event and send it to Amplitude, along with the replay. You can verify this scenario occurs if you see a discrepancy between the `End Session Client Event Time` and the `Client Upload Time`.

### Session replays don't appear in Amplitude

Session replays may not appear in Amplitude due to:

- Lack of connectivity
- Failed to flush recording before exiting the app
- No events triggered through the Android SDK in the current session
- Sampling

#### Lack of connectivity

Ensure your app has access to the internet then try again.

#### No events triggered through the Android SDK in the current session

Session Replay requires that at least one event in the user's session has the `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID` property. If you instrument your events with a method other than the [Android SDK](/docs/sdks/analytics/android/android-kotlin-sdk), the Android SDK may send only the default Session Start and Session End events, which don't include this property.

For local testing, you can force a Session Start event to ensure that Session Replay functions.

1. In Amplitude, in the User Lookup Event Stream, you should see a Session Start event that includes the `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID` property. After processing, the Play Session button should appear for that session.

#### Sampling

As mentioned above, the default `sampleRate` for Session Replay is `0`. Update the rate to a higher number. For more information see, [Sampling rate](#sampling-rate).

#### Some sessions don't include the Session Replay ID property

Session replay doesn't require that all events in a session have the `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID` property, only that one event in the session has it. Reasons why `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID`  may not be present in an event include:

- The user may have opted out or may not be part of the sample set given the current `sampleRate`. Increasing the `sampleRate` captures more sessions.
- Amplitude events may still send through your provider, but `getSessionReplayProperties()` doesn't return the `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID` property. This can result from `optOut` and `sampleRate` configuration settings. Check that `optOut` and `sampleRate` are set to include the session.

### Session Replay processing errors

In general, replays should be available within minutes of ingestion. Delays or errors may be the result of one or more of the following:

- Mismatching API keys or Device IDs. This can happen if Session Replay and standard event instrumentation use different API keys or Device IDs.
- Session Replay references the wrong project.
- Short sessions. If a users bounces within a few seconds of initialization, the SDK may not have time to upload replay data.
- Page instrumentation. If Session Replay isn't implemented on all pages a user visits, their session may not capture properly.
- Replays older than the set [retention period](#retention-period) (defaults to 90 days).
