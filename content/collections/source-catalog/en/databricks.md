Amplitude's Databricks import source enables you to import data from Databricks to your Amplitude account. Databricks import uses the [Databricks Change Data Feed](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/delta-change-data-feed.html#use-delta-lake-change-data-feed-on-databricks) feature to securely access and extract live data from your Databricks workspace.

For guided instructions to setting up this integration, view the [Loom video](https://www.loom.com/share/a00f8905170e4c83977ae6fb2f0dcde7?sid=5a77e8c9-d34b-42b0-a179-679669c8bdbe).

## Features

- Import all data types, including events, user properties, and group properties.
- Support for delta sync, to ensure Amplitude imports only new or changed data.
  - For **event** data, Amplitude imports rows with an `insert` operation.
  - For **user properties** and **group properties**, Amplitude imports rows with `insert` or `update` operations.
  - Amplitude ignores rows with `delete` operations for all data types.

## Limitations

- The User Look-Up page doesn't display 100 most recent events ingested.

- The following Databricks features don't support time travel, and aren't supported by this integration:
  - [views](https://docs.databricks.com/en/views/index.html)
  - [materialized views](https://docs.databricks.com/en/views/materialized.html)
  - [streaming tables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/index.html#streaming-table)

## Configure Databricks

Before you start to configure the Databricks source in Amplitude, complete the following tasks in Databricks.

### Find or create an all-purpose compute cluster

Amplitude creates workflows in this cluster on your behalf to start sync jobs. When complete, copy the server hostname and HTTP path values to use in a later step. Find both values on the *Configuration -> JDBC/ODBC* tab. For more information about cluster types, see [Compute](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/index.html).

![where to find server host name and HTTP path](statamic://asset::help_center_conversions::destinations/integrations-databricks-import-server-hostname-http-path.png)

{{partial:admonition type="note" heading=""}}
Ensure the new cluster can run jobs by NOT having configs below in cluster's policy. See details in Databricks' article [Policy definition](https://docs.databricks.com/en/administration-guide/clusters/policy-definition.html#workload).

```json
"workload_type.clients.jobs": {
    "type": "fixed",
    "value": false
}
```
{{/partial:admonition}}

{{partial:admonition type="note" heading=""}}
Ensure that the your cluster has python version >= 3.9; Otherwise, you may see the following error in your workflow job:

```json
TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable
```
{{/partial:admonition}}

#### Cluster policies and access modes

Amplitude supports all policies and access modes. However, if your clusters have the following policies and access modes, grant the Data Reader permission (`USE CATALOG`, `USE SCHEMA`, `EXECUTE`, `READ VOLUME`, `SELECT`) to the your workspace user or service principal, whose personal access token is used to authenticate in Amplitude. Otherwise, you can't  access the tables in the unity catalog of your import source.

AWS Databricks:

| Policy                | Node        | Cluster Access mode |
|-----------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Unrestricted          | Multi node  | No isolation shared |
| Unrestricted          | Single node | No isolation shared |
| Power User Compute    | N/A         | No isolation shared |
| Legacy Shared Compute | N/A         | N/A                 |

GCP Databricks:

| Policy                | Node        | Cluster Access mode |
|-----------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Unrestricted          | Multi node  | No isolation shared |
| Unrestricted          | Single node | No isolation shared |
| Power User Compute    | N/A         | Shared              |
| Power User Compute    | N/A         | No isolation shared |
| Legacy Shared Compute | N/A         | N/A                 |

### Authentication

Amplitude's Databricks import supports authentication with [personal access tokens for Databricks workspace users](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/pat.html#pat-user), or [personal access tokens for Service Principals](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/pat.html#pat-sp). Choose Workspace User authentication for faster setup, or Service Principal authentication for finer grained control. For more information, see [Authentication for Databricks Automation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/index.html#authentication-for-databricks-automation---overview)

#### Create a workspace user personal access token (PAT)

Amplitude's Databricks import uses personal access tokens to authenticate. For the quickest setup, create a PAT for your workspace user in Databricks. For more information, see Databricks' article [Personal Access Tokens for Workspace Users](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/pat.html#databricks-personal-access-tokens-for-workspace-users)

#### Create a service principal personal access token (PAT)

Amplitude recommends that you create a [service principal](https://docs.databricks.com/en/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html) in Databricks to allow for more granular control of access.

1. Follow [the Databricks instructions](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m.html) to create a service principal. Copy the UUID for use in a later step.
2. Generate a PAT on this Service Principal.
    
    - If you use AWS or GCP Databricks, follow the instructions in the article [Databricks personal access tokens for service principals](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/pat.html#databricks-personal-access-tokens-for-service-principals).
    - If you use Azure-based Databricks, follow the instructions in the article [Manage personal access tokens for a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals#manage-personal-access-tokens-for-a-service-principal).

The service principal you created above requires the following permissions in Databricks:

| Permission | Reason                                                                               | Location in Databricks                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workspace  | Grants access to your Databricks workspace.                                          | *Workspace → <workspace_name> → Permissions → Add permissions* <br/> Add the service principal you create with the User permission, click Save. |
| Table      | Grants access to list tables and read data.                                          | *Catalog → pick the catalog→ Permissions → Grant* <br/> Select the `Data Reader` permission (`USE CATALOG`, `USE SCHEMA`, `EXECUTE`, `READ VOLUME`, `SELECT`).             |
| Cluster    | Grants access to connect to the cluster and run workflows on your behalf             | *Compute → All-purpose compute → Edit Permission*  <br/> Add the `Add Can Attach To` permission to the service principal.            |
| Export     | Enables the service principal to unload your data through spark and export it to S3. | Run the SQL commands below in any notebook: ```GRANT MODIFY ON ANY FILE TO `<service_principal_uuid>`;``` ```GRANT SELECT ON ANY FILE TO `<service_principal_uuid>`;```                                    |

### Enable CDF on your tables

Amplitude uses the Databricks Change Data Feed to continuously import data. To enable CDF on a Databricks table, see [Databricks | Enable change data feed](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/delta-change-data-feed.html#enable-change-data-feed)

## Configure the Amplitude Databricks source

To add Databricks as a source in Amplitude, complete the following steps.

### Connect to Databricks

1. In Amplitude Data, navigate to *Catalog -> Sources*.
2. Search for **Databricks**.
3. On the *Credentials* tab of the *Connect Databricks* screen, enter the credentials you configured during the Databricks configuration:
    - Server hostname
    - HTTP Path
    - Personal Access Token (for the workspace user or Service Principal)
4. Click *Next* to verify access.

### Select data to import

1. Select the data type for data to be imported. The Databricks source supports three data types:
    - [Event](/docs/get-started/what-is-amplitude#events)
    - [User properties](/docs/get-started/what-is-amplitude#user-properties)
    - [Group properties](/docs/analytics/account-level-reporting)
    - [Profiles](/docs/data/profile-properties)
   
    For the `Event` data type, optionally select *Sync User Properties* or *Sync Group Properties* to sync the corresponding properties **within** an event.

2. Configure the SQL command that transforms data in Databricks before Amplitude imports it.
    - Amplitude treats each record in the SQL execution output as an event to be import. See the Example body in the [Batch Event Upload API](/docs/apis/analytics/batch-event-upload) documentation to ensure each record you import complies.
    - Amplitude can transform / import from only the tables you specify in step 1 above.
       - For example, if you have access to tables `A`, `B` and `C` but only selected `A` in step 1, then you can only import data from `A`.
    - The table names you reference in the SQL command must match exactly the name of the table you select in step 1. For example, if you select `catalog.schema.table1`, use that exact value in the SQL.

    ```sql 
    select 
        unix_millis(current_timestamp())                                       as time,
        id                                                                     as user_id,
        "demo"                                                                 as event_type,
        named_struct('name', name, 'home', home, 'age', age, 'income', income) as user_properties,
        named_struct('group_type1', ARRAY("group_A", "group_B"))               as groups,
        named_struct('group_property', "group_property_value")                 as group_properties
    from catalog.schema.table1;
    ```

3. After you add the SQL, click *Test SQL*. Amplitude runs a test against your Databricks instance to ensure the SQL is valid. Click *Next*.
4. Select the table version for initial import. The initial import brings everything the from table as of the selected version. Select *First* or *Latest*.
    - `First` means first version, which is 0.  
    - `Latest` means latest version.
5. Set the sync frequency. This frequency determines the interval at which Amplitude pulls data from Databricks.
6. Enter a descriptive name for this instance of the source.
7. The source appears in the Sources list for your workspace.

## Verify data import

Events that Amplitude imports assume the name you assign in your SQL statement. In the example above, the events have the name `demo`

To verify the data coming into Amplitude:

- View the Events page of your Tracking Plan
- Create a Segmentation chart that filters on the event name you specify. 
- Go to the `Ingestion Jobs` tab in your source. You can view the status of the ingestion and debug using `ERROR LOG` if necessary.

Depending on your company's network policy, you may need to add the following IP addresses to your allowlist to allow Amplitude's servers to access your Databricks instance:

- Amplitude US IP addresses:
    - 52.33.3.219
    - 35.162.216.242
    - 52.27.10.221 
- Amplitude EU IP addresses:
    - 3.124.22.25
    - 18.157.59.125
    - 18.192.47.195
